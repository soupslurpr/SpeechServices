# Speech Services

Speech Services provides fast, efficient, and high-quality text-to-speech for 
[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org) using state-of-the-art models running completely on-device. 

It uses our fork of Matcha-TTS with major speed and efficiency improvements alongside a phonemizer 
written in Kotlin, based on the Misaki phonemizer and the Apache OpenNLP library for text 
preprocessing.
